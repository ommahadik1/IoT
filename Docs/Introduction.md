# Introduction to the Internet of Things (IoT)

## What is IoT?
The **Internet of Things (IoT)** is a network of physical devices — from everyday household items to complex industrial machines — connected to the internet so they can **collect, exchange, and act upon data**.

IoT devices can work:
- Independently, making automated decisions.
- In coordination with other devices.
- Interacting with users via smartphones, computers, or voice assistants.

## Why IoT Matters
- **Efficiency:** Automates repetitive tasks.
- **Insights:** Offers better understanding of system performance.
- **Convenience:** Allows remote monitoring and control.
- **Innovation:** Enables entirely new services and applications.

Example:
A **smart thermostat** adjusts temperature automatically based on your habits, saving energy and improving comfort.
