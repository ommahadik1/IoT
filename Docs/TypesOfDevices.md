# Types of IoT Devices

IoT devices come in two broad categories:

## 1. General Devices
These are regular appliances enhanced with IoT capabilities for smart functionality:
- Smart refrigerators: Monitor contents, notify when items run low.
- Smart washing machines: Remote start, suggest optimal cycles.
- Smart air conditioners: Controlled by apps or voice commands.
- Smart lighting systems: Automated or remotely controlled.

## 2. Sensing Devices
These gather environmental or operational data:
- Temperature sensors: Measure heat, water temp, or ambient temp.
- Light brightness detectors: Adjust lights automatically.
- Humidity/pressure sensors: Monitor atmosphere or equipment.
- Motion detectors: Enable security and automation features.

Sensors are crucial for **automation, analytics, and predictive maintenance**.
