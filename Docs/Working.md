# How IoT Works – Data Flow Overview

The IoT ecosystem follows a sequence of steps from data collection to action:

## Step 1: Data Collection
Devices record information through:
- Embedded sensors.
- Inputs from users.

## Step 2: IoT Gateway Communication
An **IoT Gateway** connects devices to the cloud for data management.
- **HTTP** – Web-based communication.
- **MQTT** – Lightweight, efficient messaging protocol for IoT.

## Step 3: Cloud Processing
The cloud:
- Stores and analyzes data.
- Runs **Machine Learning** or **AI** models.
- Generates meaningful insights.

## Step 4: Command Execution
Processed results are sent back to:
- Devices for automatic action.
- User apps (e.g., smartphone dashboards) for manual control.

**Example:**
A smart irrigation system turns water flow on/off based on soil moisture data.
